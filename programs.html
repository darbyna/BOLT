                    <p style="color: white;"> In the <b><em>BOLT Biology Program</em></b>, students will be able to attain hands-on experience in various fields of the biological sciences. For instance, students will learn
                    laboratory techniques in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, ornithology, herpetology, and more. Each hands-on session will be taught by an experienced Ph.D. or leading industry professional.
                    This is to ensure that the students are able to procure the best education and experience possible. Once students complete the<b><em>BOLT Biology Program</em></b>, they will receive the <b><em>BOLT Biology Certificate of Completion</em></b>.
                    </p>
                        <h2 style="color:goldenrod;">BOLT Sequence Program (BSP) </h2>
                            <p style="color: white;"> The <b><em>BOLT Sequence Program (BSP)</em></b> will provide students with a digital animation of each biological pathway that is taught. This will ensure that students are able to have the best visual representation of the 
                            biological processes and thus have an enhanced comprehension of the topics. </p>
